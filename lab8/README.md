Lab 8: Dynamic Projects Page

By creating a JSON file containing a description and link to each lab, 
I was able to use ajax to read the dile and dynamically output a menu so that
the projects page can more easily be updated. I used the JQueryUI accordion menu
to hide and display links and descriptions for each lab in order to minimize the
amount of text on the page at a given time.
