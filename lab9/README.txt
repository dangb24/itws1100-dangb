LAB 9: PHP & MYSQL

For this lab, we created a SQL database with two tables, one with the names and birthdates 
of actors, and one with the title and years of movies. Using PHP, we created a program
which displays these tables and allows the user to add and remove actors and movies 
from each. Lastly, we created a relationship table associating certain actors with 
their corresponding movies.
