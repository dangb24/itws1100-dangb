This folder contains the XML files for Lab 4. 
Intro ITWS - Lab 4 - RSS.xml contains an RSS feed and Intro ITWS - Lab 4 -Atom.xml contains an Atom feed.
Both feeds include links to a range of articles from different sources, covering a range of subject matter from
science and technology to contemporary architecture.

UPDATE:
Using AJAX to extract the information for each feed from the RSS and Atom files, the feeds are now able to be styled
according to my site.
